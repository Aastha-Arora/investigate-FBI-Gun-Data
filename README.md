# Investigate FBI Gun Data

### Objective
The objective of this project to investigate a dataset using the Data Analysis Process.

### DataSet
The data comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NICS is used by to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. Gun shops call into this system to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or isnâ€™t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase.

The FBI provides data on the number of firearm checks by month, state, and type. The data represents the number of firearm background checks initiated through the NICS. They do not represent the number of firearms sold. Based on varying state laws and purchase scenarios, a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale. Despite some caveats listed with the dataset, it is the best proxy for total gun sales.

### Research Questions
- Which states sell the most guns and least guns in the U.S.?
- What is the overall trend of gun purchases?
- Which states have has the highest growth in gun sales?

### Conclusions
Texas, California, Pennsylvania, Florida and Ohio are the top 5 stats in the U.S where the most guns are sold.

The sales of guns has increased over the years. The month wise plot of gun sales shows a seasonal pattern. Based on the data, it appears that most gun sales are during the winter months - December and January.

Florida has a high growth in gun sales, ie. 301.08%. The number of guns sold in year 1999 were 260,824 and increased to 1,046,121 in 2016.

Sales droped in year 2014 for all the 5 states with most gun sales. 

### Limitations

The dataset provides data on the number of firearm checks by month, state, and type. The data represents the number of firearm background checks initiated through the NICS. They do not represent the number of firearms sold. Hence, it not possible to get the actual number of guns sold in any state as depending on the state laws, background check may not be required for some sales.

The data provided is aggregated month wise. Weekly or daily analysis of gun registeration cannot be performed using this data.
